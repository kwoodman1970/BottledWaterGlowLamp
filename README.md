# BottledWaterGlowLamp
*Turn your smartphone or tablet into a glow lamp by placing a bottle of water on the screen!*

I made this many years ago as an exercise while I was learning how to make [progressive web apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps) that can run unaltered universally on any mobile device.  It uses the now-obsolete [appcache manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5) method; a future task would be to update this with the newer [service workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps#Service_workers) method (after I've learned it).

For best results, use a room-temperature 500ml bottle of water in a very, very dark space.

I was inspired to create this after seeing a similar app on an app store and saying to myself, "Cool!  I think I can do better."

## Opening the Web Page

Open your device's browser (Safari is recommended for iPhone & iPad users) and use the following link:

_link coming soon_

## Adding To Your Home Screen

This will let you use the app even when you don't have access to the Internet.  **Caveat:**  as mentioned above, the technology to do this is obsolete and newer devices may not behave this way &ndash; YMMV.

Mobile browsers vary widely by device and manufacturer, so look in the browser's menu for something like "Share" and/or "Add to Home Screen" and follow the directions.  If you're using an iPhone or iPad then Safari may be required due to Apple's security system.

## Future Tasks

No timeline or estimate is given for these.

* Implement service worker method
* Add detailed instructions for adding to home screen
