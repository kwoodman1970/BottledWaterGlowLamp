## About This Project

I started making this some time around 2016 as an exercise while I was self-learning how to make [progressive web apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps) that can run unaltered universally on any mobile device.  It uses the now-obsolete [appcache manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5) method; a future task would be to update this with the newer [service workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps#Service_workers) method (after I've learned it).

For best results, use a **room-temperature** 500ml bottle of water in a very, very dark space.

I was inspired to create this after seeing a similar app on an app store and saying to myself, "Cool!  I think I can do better."

## How to Install

Progressive web apps aren't generally distributed through app stores and must therefore be installed manually through a web browser.  **Caveat:**  as mentioned above, the installation technique used by this app is obsolete and newer devices may not allow installation or may require Internet access for the app to run &ndash; YMMV.

In your mobile device's web browser (Safari may be required for iPhone & iPad users), enter or tap on the following link:

<https://kwoodman1970.github.io/BottledWaterGlowLamp/>

This web page will do its best to detect which device you're using and show you appropriate instructions, but mobile browsers vary widely by device and manufacturer.  You may have to look in your browser's menu for something like "Share" and/or "Add to Home Screen" and follow the directions.  A search engine may be your friend, too.

Once the browser has indicated that the app is on the home screen, you can close the web page and the browser.

## How to Use


### Prerequisites

You will need:

- A **room-temperature** bottle of water (500ml would be a good size)
- A dark place &ndash; the darker, the better

### Instructions

**WARNING:  Not responsible for *any* damage caused to your device &ndash; use at your own risk!**

For best results, maximize the screen's brightness.

1. Open the app from the device's home screen.
2. Use the controls to select a pattern, a speed and a size for the illumination circle.  The size of the illumination circle should be about the same as the diameter of the water bottle.
3. Go to your dark place (literally, not mentally!).
4. Place the device face-up on a flat surface.
5. Place the bottle of water on the screen directly on top of the illumination circle.

## Technologies Used

- [DHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML) ([HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript/))
- [Appcache Manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5/)

## TODO

No timeline or estimate is given.

* Implement the [service workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps#Service_workers) method for compatibility with newer devices
* Moving the app's files to a subdirectory to de-clutter the repository's root directory
